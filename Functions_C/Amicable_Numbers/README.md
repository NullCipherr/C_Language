🧮 Finding Pairs of Amicable Numbers

	This C code finds and displays pairs of amicable numbers in the range from 1 to N, where N is the input number. It uses the sumDivisors function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number and identifies pairs of amicable numbers within the specified range.

🔧 How to Use

1. 🛠️ Make sure you have a C development environment set up on your system.


2. 📥 Clone the repository or download the source code.


3. 🛠️ Compile the code using a C compiler. For example, if you're using GCC, execute the following command in the terminal:

 gcc your_code_name.c -o your_executable_name

Replace your_code_name.c with the name of the source code file and your_executable_name with the desired name for the executable.


4. ⚙️ Run the program with an 'N' argument, where 'N' is the upper limit to find pairs of amicable numbers:

 ./your_executable_name N

Replace your_executable_name with the name of the executable generated in the previous step and N with the desired upper limit.


5. 📈 The program will find and display pairs of amicable numbers in the range from 1 to N.

📜 Example Usage

To find pairs of amicable numbers up to the number 100, execute the following command:

 ./your_executable_name 100

These READMEs provide simple instructions on how to compile and run each of the C codes and how to use command-line arguments to control their behavior. Make sure to adapt the file and executable names according to your specific development environment.
