üßπ Selection Sort Algorithm

This C code implements the Selection Sort algorithm to efficiently sort an array in ascending order. Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning. It's one of the most straightforward sorting methods and works well for small datasets.

Implementation Details

1. üïµÔ∏è findSmallestPosition: Function to find the position of the smallest element in an array.
2. üîÑ swap: Function to swap two integers.
3. üßπ selectionSort: Function to perform Selection Sort on an array.

Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC.

 							   gcc your_code_name.c -o your_executable_name

	Replace your_code_name.c with the name of the source code file and your_executable_name with the desired name for the executable.


2. Run the program.

 								./your_executable_name


3. The program will sort the provided array in ascending order using Selection Sort.


Example Output

The program will display the sorted array in ascending order, showing the position of each element.


Customization
You can customize the array values and size in the main function to sort different datasets.


This README provides an overview of the Selection Sort algorithm applied to sorting an array with figurines for visual appeal. Remember to replace your_code_name.c with the actual name of your source code file and your_executable_name with the desired name for the executable when compiling and running the code.
