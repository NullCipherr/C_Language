ðŸ§¹ Insertion Sort Algorithm

This C code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to efficiently sort an array in ascending order. Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted datasets.

Problem Description
--------------------

1. ðŸ“Š Array Size: size of the array to be sorted.

Implementation Details
-----------------------

1. ðŸ¤ž insertionSort: Function to perform Insertion Sort on an array.

Usage
------

1. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC:.

gcc your_code_name.c -o your_executable_name

	Replace `your_code_name.c` with the name of the source code file and `your_executable_name` with the desired name for the executable.

2. Run the program


3. Input the array

	Enter the size of the array and its elements when prompted.


4. View the sorted array

	The program will display the original and sorted arrays, allowing you to verify the correctness of the Sorting algorithm.


Example Output
--------------

The program will demonstrate the sorted array, allowing you to verify the correctness of the Sorting algorithm.


Customization
-------------

You can customize the array size and elements in the `main` function to sort different datasets.


ðŸš€ Happy Sorting!

This README provides an overview of the Insertion Sort algorithm applied to sorting an array, along with instructions on how to compile, run, and customize the code. Remember to replace `your_code_name.c` with the actual name of your source code file and `your_executable_name` with the desired name for the executable when compiling and running the code.
