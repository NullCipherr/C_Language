 ðŸ§¹ Insertion Sort Algorithm
--------------------

This C code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to efficiently sort an array in ascending order. Insertion Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that builds the sorted portion of an array one element at a time. It's efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data. This algorithm is known for its simplicity and stability but becomes inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity. It's best suited when you have limited data or data that's already partially sorted.


Problem Description
--------------------

1. ðŸ“Š Array Size: size of the array to be sorted.


Implementation Details
-----------------------

1. ðŸ¤ž insertionSort: Function to perform Insertion Sort on an array.


Usage
------

1. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC:

 							   gcc your_code_name.c -o your_executable_name

	Replace `your_code_name.c` with the name of the source code file and `your_executable_name` with the desired name for the executable.

2. Run the program


3. Input the array

	Enter the size of the array and its elements when prompted.


4. View the sorted array

	The program will display the original and sorted arrays, allowing you to verify the correctness of the Sorting algorithm.


Example Output
--------------

The program will demonstrate the sorted array, allowing you to verify the correctness of the Sorting algorithm.


Customization
-------------

You can customize the array size and elements in the `main` function to sort different datasets.



ðŸš€ Happy Sorting!

This README provides an overview of the Insertion Sort algorithm applied to sorting an array, along with instructions on how to compile, run, and customize the code. Remember to replace `your_code_name.c` with the actual name of your source code file and `your_executable_name` with the desired name for the executable when compiling and running the code.
