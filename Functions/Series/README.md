📈 Calculation of the Sum of a Fraction Series

This C code calculates the sum of a series composed of a sequence of terms obtained through fractions. You can use this program to calculate the sum of the first 'n' terms in the series.

🔧 How to Use

1. 🛠️ Make sure you have a C development environment set up on your system.


2. 📥 Clone the repository or download the source code.


3. 🛠️ Compile the code using a C compiler. For example, if you're using GCC, execute the following command in the terminal:
 
 							   gcc your_code_name.c -o your_executable_name

	Replace your_code_name.c with the name of the source code file and your_executable_name with the desired name for the executable.


4. ⚙️ Run the program with an 'n' argument, where 'n' is the number of terms in the series you want to calculate:

 								   ./your_executable_name n

	Replace your_executable_name with the name of the executable generated in the previous step and n with the desired number of terms.


5. 📊 The program will calculate the sum of the series with the 'n' terms and display the result in the output.


📜 Example Usage

To calculate the sum of the first 5 terms of the series, execute the following command:

 								./your_executable_name 5

 
These READMEs provide simple instructions on how to compile and run each of the C codes and how to use command-line arguments to control their behavior. Make sure to adapt the file and executable names according to your specific development environment.
