The code aims to solve a course scheduling problem by optimizing the allocation of courses to rooms and time slots based on a matrix of conflicts and room capacity constraints. The goal is to find an allocation that minimizes the total cost, taking into account the following factors:

Course-Room Conflicts: The "conflicts" matrix stores information about conflicts between courses and rooms. A higher value in a matrix position indicates a greater conflict between the course and the corresponding room.

Room Capacities: The code checks whether the capacity of a room is exceeded when courses are assigned to it. If the capacity is exceeded, an additional cost is added.

Simulated Annealing: The algorithm used to optimize the allocation is "Simulated Annealing." It starts with a random initial solution and gradually adjusts this solution to minimize the total cost. This is achieved through a series of iterations where neighboring solutions are randomly generated and accepted with a certain probability, depending on the cost difference and the current temperature.

The ultimate goal is to find the best allocation of courses to rooms and time slots that minimizes the total cost while considering conflicts and room capacity constraints. This is valuable in scenarios such as university course scheduling, classroom timetabling, or any situation where efficient resource allocation is needed.
