🔥 Tabu Search Algorithm for Optimization

Tabu Search is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that can be applied to solve various combinatorial optimization problems. This C code showcases the use of Tabu Search to solve a simple optimization problem. The objective is to find the best solution by iteratively exploring neighboring solutions and maintaining a tabu list to avoid revisiting previous states.


Problem Description

1. 🎯 Problem Size: PROBLEM_SIZE

2. ⏰ Maximum Iterations: MAX_ITERATIONS

3. 📋 Tabu Tenure: TABU_TENURE

4. 🌌 Maximum Random Value: MAX_RANDOM_VALUE

The objective function is defined to maximize a simple value calculated from a solution.


Implementation Details

1. 📈 objective_function: Function to calculate the objective value of a solution.

2. 📇 copy_solution: Function to copy the content of one solution to another.

3. 📌 update_best_solution: Function to update the best solution if a better solution is found.

4. 🏁 initialize_solution: Function to initialize the initial solution with random values.

5. 🔄 generate_neighbor: Function to generate a neighboring solution by swapping two random elements.



Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC.

 							   gcc your_code_name.c -o your_executable_name

	Replace your_code_name.c with the name of the source code file and your_executable_name with the desired name for the executable.


2. Run the program.

 								./your_executable_name


3. The program will perform Tabu Search to find the best solution.


Example Output

The program will display the progress at each iteration, including the best solution found, the value of the objective function, and the status of the tabu list.


Customization

You can customize the problem size, maximum iterations, tabu tenure, and the range of random values according to your specific problem.


This README provides an overview of the Tabu Search algorithm applied to a simple optimization problem. It includes figurines to make the information more engaging. Remember to replace your_code_name.c with the actual name of your source code file and your_executable_name with the desired name for the executable when compiling and running the code.
